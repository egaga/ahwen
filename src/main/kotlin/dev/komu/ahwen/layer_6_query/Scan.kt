/**
 * Represents an operator of relational algebra.
 *
 * Each supported operator of will have a one or more [Scan]-implementations that perform
 * the functionality of the operator. In theory only one implementation per operator would
 * be enough, but since different implementations have different performance characteristics,
 * its useful to have several (e.g. the optimal way to perform a join depends on several
 * factors).
 *
 * For each [Scan], there is a corresponding [Plan], then can be used to reason about the
 * performance characteristics of the scan without actually executing it.
 *
 * Some scans support updating the scanned records; those will implement [UpdateScan].
